# Outlier-Parity

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. 
Yhe array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a 
single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.
